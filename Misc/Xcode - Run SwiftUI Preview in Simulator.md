Feedback:
The Xcode SwiftUI Preview often fails with mysterious errors unrelated to the code to be previewed:

Suggestion: It would be great if it would be possible to run the current file's first `#Preview` in the iOS Simulator with a plain and rock-solid workflow that can never fail because of errors that are not related to my code.
