> FB19359821 PresentationDetent to auto-size sheet to the height of the contained Views
> 
> I suggest a `PresentationDetent.sizeToFit` or `PresentationDetent.contentSize` that automatically sizes the sheet to the height of the contained Views.

> This seems to be a common requirement for many app developers and it would be nice if this would be supported out of the box without fiddling around with the usual GeometryReader in background -> make available the height with a preference key -> .presentationDetents([.height(â€¦)]) workarounds.
