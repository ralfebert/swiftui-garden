> ### FB19252284: Support for side/corner-attached .sheet() with presentationDetents on iPad
>
> Iâ€™m suggesting to add support for .sheet() with presentationDetents on iPad; with the sheet then attaching to the side / to the corner of the screen, similar to how the Maps app presents its sheet.
> 
> Currently the sheet always presents form/page-like in the middle of the screen which is of limited use for apps that want to present a map behind the sheet.
> 
> It would be great if the side/corner (trailing/leading; trailing-bottom or leading-bottom corner) and the sheet width could be configured.
> 
> Attached are screen shots of a standalone example with a custom glass container used for non-draggable sheet-like presentation and the Maps app with its fully draggable side sheet.
