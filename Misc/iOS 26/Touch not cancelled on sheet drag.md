> ### FB18927179: Button touch is not cancelled when sheet drag or scroll gesture starts on a Button inside a ScrollView inside a .sheet
>
> Steps to reproduce:
>
> - Use the attached example snippet: A Button inside a ScrollView inside a .sheet
> - Start dragging the sheet or scrolling with the finger on the Button.
>
> Expected behavior: After a little bit of drag movement, it should detect that itâ€™s a scroll/sheet drag and the Button touch should be cancelled / the button action should not be fired. This behaviour can be observed when no ScrollView is present.
>
> Observed behavior: Button touch is not cancelled and the action fires, even when the gesture clearly looked like a sheet drag/scroll.
