By default, the pinned section headers of a plain List appear overlapping the list rows on iOS 26:

Update: ðŸŽ‰ In Beta 8, if you use `.scrollEdgeEffectStyle(.hard, for: .top)`, pinned headers now appear attached to the top bar (same as `.safeAreaBar`):

To make section headers unpinned, a LazyVStack can be used as a workaround.
