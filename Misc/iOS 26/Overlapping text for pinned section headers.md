For a List with .listStyle(.plain), I think SwiftUI should have an easy way to a) un-pin headers and b) to make pinned headers appear safeAreaBar-like, attached to the top bar.

Currently, safeAreaBar or LazyVStack can be used to work around this, see https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/795159

Update: ðŸŽ‰ In Beta 8, if you use `.scrollEdgeEffectStyle(.hard, for: .top)`, the pinned headers appear attached to the safe area bar:
