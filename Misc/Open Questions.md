SwiftUI:

* NavigationStack says 'don't put models in the path' / keep the navPath struct's lightweight - but where to put state of the Views in navigation stack (so it's accessible from the outside, vs. @State) + the pattern of using case .foo(FooStep) is cumbersome when modifying state.
* Is there a way to fix the accent color in Previews for Swift packages



Swift:

* Is there a way to write `if #available(iOS 26, *)` statements so that they compile in a non-Beta Xcode? ([[Handling different iOS versions in a View body#checking-for-ios-version-api-availability]])
* Better way to do simple isCase checks for paramerized enums / get an unparameterized version of the enum?
* A convenient way to generate a public init in package types
