# About SwiftUI Garden

SwiftUI Garden is my [digital knowledge garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) about iOS development and SwiftUI. I'm digging around here while working on my [apps](https://www.ralfebert.com/apps/).

I use this space to learn and think about SwiftUI, untangled from the actual app projects, and to share my learnings and findings with the developer community.

This site is also an Xcode project and an Obsidian Vault available via [Github](https://github.com/ralfebert/swiftui-garden), see [[Project structure and automation]].
