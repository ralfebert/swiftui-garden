## Hierarchical Colors

SwiftUI provides a system of hierarchical colors that automatically adapt to light and dark modes. These should be used instead of hard-coded references to black/white/gray. Beware that these are transparent though. The classic UIKit `.systemGray` colors are included as a point of reference; also, in some cases it can be handy to refer to a specific graytone.
