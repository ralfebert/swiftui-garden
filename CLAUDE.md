* Always read `/Overview.md` and `docs/Project structure and automation.md` before starting work
* To update code snippets in the markdown documents, edit the related swift file and call `just sync` to update the markdown.
* Keep all communication and documentation briefly and concise. Write answers for a software developer with 10+ years experience, don't explain or comment trivial code.
