*SwiftUI Garden* is my [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) of SwiftUI knowledge and example code that I tinker on and curate while working on my [iOS Apps](https://www.ralfebert.com/apps/).

I use this space to learn and think about SwiftUI, untangled from the actual app project, and to share my learnings and findings with the developer community.

This site is also an Xcode project and an Obsidian Vault available via [Github](https://github.com/ralfebert/swiftui-garden), see [[Project structure and automation]].
